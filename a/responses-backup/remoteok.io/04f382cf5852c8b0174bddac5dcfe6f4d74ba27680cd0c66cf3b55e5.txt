You will use your initiative to design and implement server-side architecture, as well as implement API\u2019s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you\u2019ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware.\n\n\nOur small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 5 engineers and 3 QA specialists.

We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn\u2019t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you\u2019ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very clich\u00e9, but you\u2019ll immerse yourself in almost every department. You\u2019ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you\u2019re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you\u2019ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won\u2019t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you\u2019ll be working in almost full autonomy. We\u2019ll need to trust you to deliver the goods.

We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\n\nReact. Our frontend code is built in React, being able to go in and patch things up as and when required would be a big benefit to us. \n\nCaching. The software we\u2019re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus.\n\nCI\/CD: We\u2019re huge advocates for automated tests in a continuous fashion, which allows us to rapidly deploy new features every single day without fear of breaking out applications. \n\nWhat\u2019s the Lifestyle Like?\n \nOur company is built on the foundation of travel, remote work, and living life on your own terms.\n\nWe\u2019re not looking to put you in a cubicle and waste your time in traffic.
